As a web developer, at first I design a UI (user interface) with HTML and CSS and then will convert it to a demandable <strong>Website</strong> , <strong>Web Application</strong> or <strong>Desktop Application</strong> as the client or company requirement by using the most popular technology ( Vanilla JavaScript, Reactjs, TypeScript, Nodejs, Expressjs, MongoDB ( noSQL Database )) or others technologies I could be able to do. </p>
